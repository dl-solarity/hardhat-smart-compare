# Hardhat Smart Compare

This [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) plugin facilitates contract upgradability and provides various comparison tools.

## What

This plugin helps you make a snapshot of hardhat storage layout and use it for comparison.

With this plugin you could do the following:

* Compare snapshot with your current version of the smart contracts (SC)

[//]: # (* Compare snapshots between each other )

[//]: # (* Compare your current version of the SC with the remote version.)

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @dlsl/hardhat-smart-compare
```

And add the following statement to your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
require("@dlsl/hardhat-smart-compare");
```

Or, if you are using TypeScript, add this to your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```ts
import "@dlsl/hardhat-smart-compare";
```

## Tasks

* `storage:save` task, which allows you to save the snapshot of the storage layout.
* `storage:compare` task, which allows you to compare the current version of contracts with the previously saved snapshot.

To view the available options, run the command (help command):

```bash
npx hardhat help storage:save 
npx hardhat help storage:compare 
```

## Environment extensions

This plugin does not extend the environment.

## Usage

The plugin works out of the box: `npx hardhat storage:save` will recompile artifacts and generates special storage snapshot for all the contracts used in the project into the default folder.

### Configuration

The default configuration looks as follows. You may customize all fields in your *hardhat config* file.

```js
module.exports = {
  compare: {
    snapshotPath: "./storage_snapshots",
    snapshotFileName: "storage_snapshot.json",
  },
};
```

### Parameter explanation

* `snapshotPath` : Path to the directory where the storage layout snapshot is saved.
* `snapshotFileName` : File name of the snapshot.

## How it works

The plugin runs `compile` task, gets the artifacts from *Hardhat Runtime Environment* (HRE) and performs the following actions:

* `save` task: Writes contract's storage layouts, type definitions and inheritance impact of each contract into a file specified in the config.
* `compare` task: Generate the same data for the current version of the contracts and compares it with the previously saved snapshot, including the normalization(solving problem with different order of the fields in the storage and inheritance) and comparison of the each field of the storage based on the type, name.

### Storage layout pattern

``` json
{
  buildInfos: [
    {
      solcVersion: string,
      solcLongVersion: string,
      format: string,
      contracts: [
        name: string,
        source: string,
        entries: {
          storage:[
            astId: number,
            contract: string,
            label: string,
            offset: number,
            slot: string,
            type: string
          ],
          types: {
            [type_name: string]:  {
              base?: string,
              encoding: string,
              key?: string,
              label: string,
              members?: [
                {  
                  astId: number;
                  contract: string;
                  label: string;
                  offset: number;
                  slot: string;
                  type: string;
                }
              ],
              numberOfBytes: string
            }
          },
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  inheritanceImpact: {
     [contract: string]: string[]
  }
}
